            "You need to start with your dogâ€™s flea treatment: Flea shampoo might be recommended. The shampoo will kill the fleas on the body, and you will see them fall out of the fur as you rinse your dog. Once the shampoo has been rinsed, the effect quickly wears off. Therefore, shampoo is best used in combination with another product. Topical liquids are usually the flea treatment of choice. They take just a few hours to start working and are very effective. Prescription products tend to be most effective. Insect development inhibitors (IDI) may be administered orally. There are also injectable products that can be used. Most flea collars and powders are much less effective than the other treatments. However, a new collar called 'Seresto' is very effective and offers months of protection. The veterinarian may prescribe flea medicine for dogs to control skin irritation and soothe the itch. Make sure to keep the vet informed of the progress and be sure to contact them if you are concerned about the potential side effects of medications, liquids, or any aspect of the treatment.",
